# Explorations of Self-Repair in Language Models

This Repository holds the code used to write Explorations of Self-Repair in Language Models. All the files in FINAL_figure_files hold the most important code, wihle other miscellaneous files have been stored in extra.

By defualt, the code wasn't written to be read and is messy: as such, for any questions regarding the code, contact Cody Rushing at thisiscodyr@gmail.com

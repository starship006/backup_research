# backup_research

i'm doing research on self-repair; here is a collection of related files i've made. the summary of my findings, so far, can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17r6ce2wySluP69VO9A-Iq1ufvd6AeA3H5oR9IreGPMM/edit?usp=sharing). 


by defualt, the code isn't written be read, and is messy. at a high level, everything in `3_austin_research` represnts more current research (that I did in Fall 2023 semester at UT Austin), while the code in `older_research_graveyard` is code from the summer. the files in `3_austin_research` which start with `GOOD_` are slightly more polished than the others.
